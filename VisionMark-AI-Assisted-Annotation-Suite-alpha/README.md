# Backend Developer Task: VisionMark AI-Assisted Annotation Suite

## Overview

VisionMark is a cutting-edge, mobile-first application aimed at simplifying the data collection and annotation process for preparing training datasets for YOLO image recognition models. This task challenges you, as a backend developer candidate, to architect and implement the backend services for VisionMark. Your goal is to develop a scalable, efficient system capable of handling image processing, user management, automatic annotations, and data exporting functionalities.

### Project Scope

Your implementation should cover the following functionalities:

- **Image Processing & Storage:** Efficiently upload and store images sent from the mobile frontend.
- **Automatic Annotation:** Implement or simulate a service that performs automatic preliminary annotations on images using AI.
- **User Management:** Develop a system for user authentication and authorization, including both regular users and admins.
- **Review & Approval Workflow:** Create endpoints for admins to review, approve, or reject annotated images.
- **Data Exporting:** Allow admins to export approved annotations in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML).

## Submission Guidelines

### Deliverables

1. **Source Code:** Provide a GitHub repository link containing all source code for your backend solution.
2. **Documentation:** Include a README file in your repository with:
   - An overview of your architecture and technologies used.
   - Instructions for setting up and running your project.
   - Any assumptions made or additional features implemented.
3. **Demo (Optional):** If possible, deploy your backend service and provide a URL for live demo access.

### Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python or Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
- **Other Technologies:** Docker for containerization, any framework of your choice for RESTful API development (e.g., Flask, Django, Express.js), JWT for authentication.
